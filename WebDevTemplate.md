## Problem Statement
Waste segregation and its safe disposal has been a major problem in our city since many years. Our area people are facing problem regarding irregular arrival of the garbage vehicle and many remain unaware of it's arrival. Also it is being found that the waste is not segregated appropriately. As this is the need of the hour a website can be developed to keep a track of the vehicle and other activities related to the maintenance of the particular area as well.
