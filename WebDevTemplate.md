## Problem Statement
I have selected the problem which we(the people of our area) encounter daily, that is irregular arrival of the garbage vehicle and also some remain unaware of its arrival or won't be there at their house when the vehicle comes. Due to this 
Even if the people have the mentality of maintaining their surroundings clean they are not able to do it and in way seem helpless.


Though people are educated there is lack of awarness among them 
Regarding maintenance of their surroundings as well as garbage 
Disposal. 

So a website is being developed where people of a particular area if registered will get a notification
When the garbage vehicle arrives and also there is access to many other cleanliness activities through this 
Website.



## Proposed Solution

The website to be developed, when opened displays a brief information regarding the need of cleanliness and the situation that we are facing which is stopping us from doing so.
There will be 4 links provided .

The first one is to become a member of the team. Once it is clicked on it asks for basic information such as name, address/location, identity proof, number of people in the house, etc.
If team already exists in that colony/area then a new member can join it or else form a new team.

Second link is for receiving the notification when the vehicle arrives.
This is done by the GPS tracker of the vehicle and the location of the registered member in the website.(this is done mainly as the vehicle is irregular and some remain unaware of it's arrival which forces them to dump the waste along road side)

The third link is for becoming volunteer of this movement and spreading awarness about clean surroundings by cleaning a selected road/s once or twice in a month. This link provides the list of activities planned for that current month and the activities for coming month as well.

The fourth link gives the complete information about the number of team and team members in his/her area by requesting the user to provide the area name/address
This link also has an access to gallery where the team members upload pictures of their social work in order to encourage others.
